Space. The final frontier. It may not be as impressive as some of the 
other projects but I really enjoyed building it, except getting the 
lights to work correctly. I created an experience. I tried to recapture 
that awe from the first time I watched Star Trek. The planets 
unfortunately do not orbit, just revolve but I thing they look better 
in place like actual planets that take years to go once around.
 
All the files needed to run the scene are included, from three.min.js 
for the Orbit Controls and GTLF Loader to the pictures used as textures
for the planets and night sky to the three models in the scene. 
Enterprise takes the spotlight but there's also a space station and
even the Sputnik satellite. Since I used orbital controls, you can 
spin the scene with the left mouse button and use the right one to move.
(check between the moon and Earth) The orbital controls are not the best
on mobile devices but they do work and it looks just as nice. 
I included a screenshot of that. The screenshots don't do it justice, 
they are a bit pixelated.

It's five-year mission...to boldy go where no man has gone before!
